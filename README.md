#  About the Project
GitaGyan is an AI-powered web application that allows users to interact with the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita.
Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the system fetches the most relevant verses and explains them in simple, personalized language.

It’s designed for:
 - Students seeking clarity on life decisions
 - Spiritual seekers wanting to explore scriptures
 - Anyone curious about Indian philosophy in an interactive way
 - Bhakts, elders, and aged individuals who wish to ask their problems directly and receive guidance from the Gita

# Features
 - Verse Retrieval – Get context-based answers directly from the Bhagavad Gita
 - AI Conversations – Chat with an AI persona of Lord Krishna
 - Multi-language Support – Choose from multiple Indian & global languages
 - Save & Share – Bookmark insightful responses
 - Immersive UI – Includes background music (Krishna’s flute) for focus
 - Responsive Design – Works smoothly on mobile and desktop

# The Problem
While the Bhagavad Gita is one of the most profound spiritual texts, accessing and understanding its wisdom in the modern world comes with several challenges:
- Complex Language & Interpretation – Many translations are difficult to understand without a teacher or guru, especially for beginners.
- Scattered Resources – Knowledge is spread across books, commentaries, and websites, making it hard to find a consolidated source.
- Time-Consuming – Reading and studying all 700 verses requires time, patience, and deep focus, which most people struggle to dedicate.
- Lack of Personalized Guidance – Different people face different problems (students, professionals, elders, seekers), but finding verses relevant to one’s life situation is not easy.
- Language Barrier – Not everyone is comfortable with Sanskrit or English; accessibility in native languages is limited.
- Digital Disconnect – In today’s fast-paced lifestyle, younger generations often prefer quick, conversational learning instead of traditional long reading.
- Practical Application Gap – Many struggle to apply the teachings of the Gita to modern challenges like career confusion, stress, relationships, and decision-making.

# Our Solution
To address these challenges, GitaGyan provides an AI-powered platform that makes the wisdom of the Bhagavad Gita more accessible, personalized, and practical:
- Simplified Understanding – AI explains verses in clear, easy-to-understand language, removing barriers of complex translations.
- Consolidated Knowledge – All verses and interpretations are organized in one platform, eliminating the need to search across multiple sources.
- Quick Access – Instead of reading all 700 shlokas, users can directly ask questions and get relevant, contextual answers instantly.
- Personalized Guidance – Responses are tailored to individual life problems (students, professionals, elders, seekers), ensuring relevance.
- Multilingual Support – The platform supports multiple Indian languages, breaking down the language barrier.
- Modern Conversational Format – Offers an interactive chat interface with Lord Krishna’s persona, appealing to both young and old generations.
- Practical Applications – Provides actionable insights by mapping teachings of the Gita to real-life challenges like stress, career decisions, and relationships.
